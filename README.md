# CoPilot

The project was generated using the [Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template](https://github.com/jasontaylordev/CleanArchitecture) version 10.8.0.

## Build

Run `dotnet build` to build the solution.

The repository's `NuGet.Config` uses nuget.org as its only package source, so local, CI, and Docker restores do not depend on feeds configured on an individual machine. Package vulnerability auditing remains enabled and warnings are treated as errors.

See [CI and deployment](docs/deployment.md) for release artifacts, GitHub environment settings, credentials, database migration adoption, and rollback procedures.

## Run

To run the application:

```bash
dotnet run --project .\src\AppHost
```

The Aspire dashboard will open automatically, showing the application URLs and logs.

## Code Styles & Formatting

The template includes [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) support to help maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The **.editorconfig** file defines the coding styles applicable to this solution.

## Code Scaffolding

The template includes support to scaffold new commands and queries.

Start in the `.\src\Application\` folder.

Create a new command:

```
dotnet new ca-usecase --name CreateTodoList --feature-name TodoLists --usecase-type command --return-type int
```

Create a new query:

```
dotnet new ca-usecase -n GetTodos -fn TodoLists -ut query -rt TodosVm
```

If you encounter the error *"No templates or subcommands found matching: 'ca-usecase'."*, install the template and try again:

```bash
dotnet new install Clean.Architecture.Solution.Template::10.8.0
```

## Test

The solution contains unit, integration, and functional tests.

To run the tests:
```bash
dotnet test
```
